A collection of Physics Simulations.

This is an attempt at making simulations of different physical phenomenon (like gravity and electromagnetic forces) and objects (like pendulums)

Addition of Mathematical projections (like fractals) and graphs will also be included.

There will also be additional weather simulation.
